# FaceDiffusion
This is a diffusion model to generate faces. The code is based on [this article](https://huggingface.co/blog/annotated-diffusion). Modifications were made to use the [FDF256 dataset](https://github.com/hukkelas/FDF/blob/master/FDF256.md) instead of the fashion_mnist that the article was based on. 

This repository contains code for our paper, submitted to and accepted at Coginfocom 2023 conference.
